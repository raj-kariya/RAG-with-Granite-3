# RAG-with-Granite-3
![High Level Design of a RAG](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/_static/getting_started/basic_rag.png)

- Enter retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a cutting-edge approach that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with advanced retrieval techniques. RAG enhances the capabilities of traditional LLMs by allowing them to incorporate the most relevant and specific information from diverse data sources. Whether you need the latest research, detailed reports, or up-to-date documentation, a RAG-powered application can ensure that every response is precise, informed, and contextually relevant.

- In this guided project, you develop an AI assistant that's capable of providing expert-level, real-time answers to complex user queries drawn from your own diverse documents. Using LlamaIndex as the backbone, you'll build a RAG application that pulls in the most relevant information, ensuring that your assistant delivers accurate and timely insights. By the end of this project, you are equipped to create systems that merge advanced retrieval techniques with LLMs, enabling responses that are not only contextually aware but also incredibly accurate and up-to-dateâ€”making a significant difference in how you process and engage with scientific literature.
